### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Logo](https://github.com/Micro-PHP/.github/blob/master/logo/png/logo-color-for-github-welcome.png?raw=true)

My name is Stas and I'm glad you are on my GitHub page.

I work for a wonderful company **EPAM** on interesting projects and also try to develop my skills and share them with others.

One way is to develop an open source project [MicroFramework](https://github.com/Micro-PHP).

I will be glad to contributors and help in improving the code base of this young, but very promising project.

## I would appreciate any help, please contact me.
